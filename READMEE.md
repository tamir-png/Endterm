Project is on shop topic. We got 5 functions that code can make, and 4 of them is about shop.
Everything based on using database connection and query tools.
In "Main" class java will be working with user. He will communicate with a program through terminal.
Class DB is created to have connection with database.
"IDB" is not so important, but needed for easy connection, and some OOP specifics.
"MySQLSource" is didnt get any role, just using for more distribution.
In class "User" we got 2 methods, where first let you create new user. Second let you see all users.
In class "Product" we got 2 methods. First is used once, it lets add new products and information about product throught code.Second let see all products.
In class "Order", we just can make order, based on our user_id location.
